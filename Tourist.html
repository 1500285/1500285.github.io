<p>The UAE is a major tourist attraction.
Its most popular attraction is the city of Dubai as a whole.
The city contains multiple skyscrapers and luxury hotels.
The most notable hotel is the Burj al Arab</p>

<p>The Burj al Arab is a five-star hotel with luxury accomodations.
	It sits right on the water off the coast of Dubai.
	The hotel boasts many unique ammenities, including an option to arrive via helicopter.
	I created a fake booking on the website linked at the end of this paragraph.
	I asked for rates for two people in July, 2017 (I was "booking" this in December, 2016)
	I made it one room, from Sunday to Saturday, and looked for the best rate.
	$7,992.07. That was the best rate I found. That's for the whole room.
	That is how expensive this luxury hotel is.
	It has pools and personal butlers and is basically entirely composed of suites.

	<p>Dubai is also home to the world's tallest building: the Burj Khalifa.</p>

<p>The Burj Khalifa is, technically speaking, the world's tallest man-made structure.
	It stands over 160 stories tall in the Dubai Skyline.
	The building has observation decks on floors 148, 125, and 124.
	On the very top of the building is a transmissions spire.</p>
