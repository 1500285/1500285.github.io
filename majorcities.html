	Since we, the creators of this website, are from the Boston area, that is the information we will be divulging for travel.
	If you were to travel to the UAE from Boston, you would first most likely have to somehow get to New York City.
	From there, you will take a TransAtlantic flight to your destination in the UAE, with a possible stop to refuel in Europe.</p>
