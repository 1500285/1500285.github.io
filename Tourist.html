<p>The UAE is a major tourist attraction.
Its most popular attraction is the city of Dubai as a whole.
The city contains multiple skyscrapers and luxury hotels.
The most notable hotel is the Burj al Arab</p>

<p>The Burj al Arab is a five-star hotel with luxury accomodations.
	It sits right on the water off the coast of Dubai.
	The hotel boasts many unique ammenities, including an option to arrive via helicopter.
	I created a fake booking on the website linked at the end of this paragraph.
	I asked for rates for two people in July, 2017 (I was "booking" this in December, 2016)
	I made it one room, from Sunday to Saturday, and looked for the best rate.
	$7,992.07. That was the best rate I found. That's for the whole room.
	That is how expensive this luxury hotel is.
	It has pools and personal butlers and is basically entirely composed of suites.

	<p>Dubai is also home to the world's tallest building: the Burj Khalifa.</p>
<br>

<p>The Burj Khalifa is, technically speaking, the world's tallest man-made structure.
	It stands over 160 stories tall in the Dubai Skyline.
	The building has observation decks on floors 148, 125, and 124.
	On the very top of the building is a transmissions spire.
	While Dubai as a city is recovering from an ecconomic crisis, the Burj Khalifa still remains a large draw for tourists around the world.
	The main requirement for this is not to be afraid of heights.
	I mean, it is pretty big......</p>

<p>Abu Dhabi, the capital of the UAE, is famous for its indoor amusement park known as Ferrari World.
	The park, if seen from above, looks like a giant warped triangle with the Ferrari logo on it.
	The entire park is, as suggested by the name, themed to Ferrari, the car company.
	It has specialized rides for the company, as well as a comedy show with two goofballs changing a tire.
	Ferrari World is most famous, however, for boasting the fastest roller coaster in the world.</p>
<p>The name of this coaster is: Formula Rossa.
	Manufactured by the Swiss Company Intamin, it can reach speeds of up to 149mph.
	It attains such speed through a high-speed launch.
	A mechanism is attached to the underside of the train, and it pulls it forward via a high-speed winch.
	Eventually, the train detaches from the launch mechanism, and physics take over until the train hits the final brake run.
	Because of its intense speed, all riders are required to wear specialized protective goggles, regardless of if they already wear glasses.
	Additionally, the park asks riders not to ride the coaster twice in a span of 15 minutes or less.
	Formula Rossa draws enthusiasts from all over the world to ride this landmark attraction, boosting the park's popularity.</p>
